- Developed the dynamic model of a quadrotor and implemented a PD controller and an A*-based path planning
algorithm in Python to successfully navigate the quadrotor and avoid obstacles in complex indoor environments.
- Implemented a min-snap trajectory optimization algorithm in Python to ensure smooth and rapid motion for
the robot.
- Built and tested a filter-based visual-inertial odometry (VIO) system that integrates information from an IMU and
a stereo camera, and demonstrated its performance in simulation
