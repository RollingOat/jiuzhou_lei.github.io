- Involved in a forest mapping project, developed metric-semantic mapping algorithm for autonomous UAVs to monitor
forest growth. Addressed challenges in accurate tree position measurement and diameter profile maintenance using
3D LiDAR data
- Implemented centralized factor graph optimization for trajectory estimation and mapping for a multi-robot system
